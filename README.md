# Strategy Toggle UI

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive UI built using **React (Vite) and plain CSS** to render a strategy toggle slider, date dropdown, and strategy cards. The UI ensures an interactive and seamless user experience without using external libraries like Bootstrap.

## Features
- **Slider Toggle**: Allows users to switch between four views: **Bullish, Bearish, RangeBound, Volatile**.
- **Date Dropdown**: Populated dynamically using `dateArray`, with the first date selected by default.
- **Strategy Cards**:
  - Rendered based on the selected date from the dropdown.
  - Displays the **strategy name** and **strategy count**.
  - If a strategy appears more than once, the count is shown; otherwise, it's labeled as `Strategy`.
- **Empty State Handling**: If no strategies are available for the selected date, an empty state message is displayed.
- **Fully Responsive**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience.

## Tech Stack
- **React (Vite)**: Fast and lightweight frontend framework
- **Plain CSS**: Custom styling without external libraries
